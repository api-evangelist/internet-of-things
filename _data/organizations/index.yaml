  description: AWS IoT is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily
    and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT can support
    billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those
    messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely. With AWS
    IoT, your applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices,
    all the time, even when they aren&rsquo;t connected. AWS IoT makes it easy to
    use AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Machine Learning,
    Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service
    with built-in Kibana integration, to build IoT applications that gather, process,
    analyze and act on data generated by connected devices, without having to manage
    any infrastructure.

    a RESTful API. Ninja Blocks address the critical element of interoperability -
    addressing (how do you identify a device), authentication (are you allowed to

    mission is to enable real interoperability in the fledgling world of the Internet
