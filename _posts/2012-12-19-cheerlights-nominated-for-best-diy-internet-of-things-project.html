<p>CheerLights is a worldwide network of multicolored lights that are synchronized together.When one color changes, all of the lights around the world change to that color.Colors are changed by sending a Tweet mentioning “cheerlights” and a color.This project is part of ioBridge Labs where we spend time on research and development of new projects, typically focused on the Internet of Things.CheerLights emerged from one of our Skunk Works projects.</p>
