<p>The Internet of Things is a vision.It is being built today.The stakeholders are known, the debate has yet to start.In hundreds of years our real needs have not changed.We want to be loved, feel safe, have fun, be relevant in work and friendship, be able to support our families and somehow play a role - however small - in the larger scheme of things.</p>
