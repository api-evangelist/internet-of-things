<p>Summary: 			The internet of things will be big… eventually.But first companies will have to navigate rapidly changing technology ecosystems and perhaps fight for access to the data to make their devices worth with others.What we need are open ecosystems akin to Android.Remember how I said the internet of things would be big at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas?It didn’t take a genius to figure that out, but I laid out four questions to ask about all the hyped objects at the show to help people understand the challenges and question facing the glut of connected gadgets that would be on display.</p>
