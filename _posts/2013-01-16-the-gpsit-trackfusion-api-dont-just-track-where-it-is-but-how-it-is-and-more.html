<p>The XML-based open architecture,  SOAP-based GPSit API allows you to integrate its GPS tracking system to focus on four main tasks: real time logistics, transit condition monitoring in cold chain shipping as well as regular transit, surveillance,  and asset management.on the logistics front, using a battery-powered device with the GPSit Trackfusion platform can identify precisely where a shipment is, allowing for notification to customers of early shipments, rerouting goods to avoid delays caused by problems along the route, oversee independent drivers among other advantages.With Cold chain shipping, suppliers and customers need to know not only where a shipment is but whether it’s being kept under conditions they contracted for.As GPSit says, there is more to it than a thermometer reading, but humidity as well,





GPSit can provide much more than just location information through its API, as the company suggests on its blog,


Preventing and addressing theft is a big target for GPSit.In a gripping video,  GPSit shows ATM theft to be a big problem–suggesting that its services can facilitate capturing stolen ATMs and perhaps deterring theft to begin with.</p>
