<p>Right now, a lot of companies are gearing up for Mobile World Congress – and Layer 7 is no exception.I’m attending MWC and I’ll be interested to see how the Internet of Things (IoT) and M2M play out at the conference.IoT has been getting a lot of attention recently, so – in preparation for MWC – let’s take a look at some of the most interesting things that have been said and done in the last couple of months.I’m particularly excited about a very ambitious EU-funded project to map an IoT reference architecture.Whether it will really become the reference architecture or simply a collection of best practices is subject to debate but I think the simple fact of trying to pull together all the different knowledge domains into one set of documents is bound to be interesting.</p>
