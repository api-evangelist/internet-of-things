<p>John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, just published a good blog entry about the potential for change caused by universal connectivity, not just of our mobile gadgets, but of pretty much everything.Much has been made of late of the so-called “Internet of Things (IoT)”, to which Cisco is upping the scope and going so far as to make a bold estimate that 99.4% of objects still remain unconnected.This of course is great fodder for late night talk show hosts.I’ll leave this softball to them, and focus instead on some of the more interesting points in Chamber’s post and the accompanying white paper.</p>
