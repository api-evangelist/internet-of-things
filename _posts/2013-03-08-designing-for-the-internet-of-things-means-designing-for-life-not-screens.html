<p>Summary: 			When it comes to building connected products and services, developers must abandon their screen-centric focus and figure out how people live their lives and how a new product can fit into those lives.With computer programs and mobile applications, people seek out physical devices on which to use them.When designing a service for the internet of things, however, the trick is to build something that’s almost invisible — but not so invisible that people won’t interact with it.At our GigaOM internet of things meetup held last week in San Francisco, Jawbone’s Roberto Tagliabue explained why that’s a design challenge that’s tough to deal with.In his talk, the designer, who helped build the Nike+, discussed the challenges of making those devices social as a means to get more people to buy them and then use them.</p>
