<p>Summary: 			We may accept that the internet of things will become commonplace in the next few years, but how do we build out the network and processing required to support it?When it comes to building out the broadband infrastructure, the data networks and the processing for the internet of things, we’re going to have to make some changes.That’s the message I got from conversations with a variety of people and from panels at South by Southwest in Austin this weekend.When considering washing machines that tweet, inventory-tracking sensors that send a few pieces of data or home health monitoring systems that are tracking someone’s heartbeat, most people assume the data is so small that the network can handle it.But today’s networks are designed to fulfill very different scenarios.</p>
