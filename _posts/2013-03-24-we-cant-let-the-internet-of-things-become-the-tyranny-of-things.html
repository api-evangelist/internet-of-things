<p>Summary: 			The Internet of Things isn’t just some futuristic concept — it already exists.But often badly.For it to succeed, it will need an economy supported by developers who can rely on open standards and APIs.If you’re one to track the Q rating of tech trends, then you know the cloud is so last minute and big data is good for little more than wrapping fish at Whole Foods.For 2013, it’s all about the Internet of Things.</p>
