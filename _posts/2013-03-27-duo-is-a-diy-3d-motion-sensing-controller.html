<p>The Duo is a 3D motion sensing controller, much like the Leap Motion Controller and the Kinect – but with a DIY twist.Whereas the Leap Motion Controller comes in a small and elegant package, the Duo is meant to be tinkered with.A $20 contribution on their Kickstarter page is enough to nab detailed instructions, a comprehensive list of the off-the-shelf components, and CAD files – enough for hardcore DIYers to jump right in and assemble their very own motion controller.For the less courageous, a $140 contribution will get you a fully assembled Duo, ready for plug and play out of the box.The Duo uses two PlayStation Eye cameras (a webcam for Sony’s PS3 gaming console that is readily available in stores) to detect motion.</p>
