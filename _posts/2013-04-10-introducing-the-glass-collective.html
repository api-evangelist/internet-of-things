  A lot of work remains to be done between today and the full realization of the Glass vision.The exciting part about todayâ€™s announcement of the Glass Collective is that just like with the Internet and smartphones, a huge amount of that work will be done by third-party developers, who are going to have in Glass a brand new platform and springboard for creativity to play with.</p>
