<p>Google just notified everybody on the Google Glass waiting list that it is “seeing the first few devices come off the production line right now.” Google says it wants to start shipping the devices as soon as possible and doesn’t want to wait until it has produced enough to fully satisfy demand.Because of this, Glass will ship out in batches to the 2,000 “Glass Explorers” who signed up at Google’s I/O developer conference in San Francisco last year.As far as we can see, those users who signed up for Glass through the #iwantglass campaign have not received this email yet and won’t be in the first batch.Update: Google has now also posted its developer guides for using the Glass Mirror API.</p>
