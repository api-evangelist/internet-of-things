<p>Earlier today, Google announced that it is about to ship its first Google Glass units and just in time for them to arrive, Google has now also posted the developer guidelines for its Glass Mirror API.Access to the API itself, it’s worth noting, is still in limited preview and only developers who have access to the Glass hardware will be able to work with the API.Everybody else can also start working on apps based on the documentation but won’t be able to test them.This first version of the API, which will allow developer to write what Google likes to call “Glassware,” is still relatively limited and the most advanced feature developers get access to is probably the Glass wearer’s location.Because every application communicates with Glass through Google’s servers, the API provides developers with a set of RESTful services and is completely cloud-based and none of the code will actually run on Glass itself.</p>
