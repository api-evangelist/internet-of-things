<p>Youll see no ads from Glassware apps here.(Credit: Google)  
  Google, which relies on advertising for some 95 percent of its revenue, doesnt want ads on its hotly anticipated Google Glass eyewear.The blanket prohibition came in the fine print of a policy made public this evening, which says Glassware developers may not serve or include any advertisements and they may not charge users to download apps for the device.Todays announcement, which coincided with news that  Google Glass Explorer Edition prototypes were about to ship, indicates that the Mountain View company is proceeding carefully, even slowly, when allowing third-party developers access to the head mounted displays full capabilities.It also means that developers wont have an obvious way of making money from their apps.</p>
