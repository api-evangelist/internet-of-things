SAN FRANCISCO, April 16 (Reuters) - Computers controlled by a swipe of the hand - a staple of science fiction flicks like Minority Report - could soon hit the mass market as the result of a new deal between Hewlett-Packard Co and a San Francisco startup called Leap Motion.As the worlds largest PC maker, HPs move to embrace motion-sensing technology could potentially change how people interface with computers in the same way that Apple Inc  made touch-screen technology mainstream with the 2007 launch of the iPhone - or when Apple first introduced the mouse to consumers in 1983.Leap Motion, a three-year-old firm with less than 100 employees in San Francisco, manufactures sensor units about the size of a pack of gum, which it claims can track the individual movements of 10 fingers with 1/100th of a millimeter precision.The units can plug into any computer and allow the use of apps or software designed for motion-control sensors.Under the new deal, HP will initially ship Leap Motions sensors with its products before eventually embedding the technology directly into HP computers, the companies said.</p>
