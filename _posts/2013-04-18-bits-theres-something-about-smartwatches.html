<p>Rumor has it that Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft are all working on some sort of thingamajig that is worn around the wrist, which people are calling a smartwatch.None have arrived on the market yet, but they have everyone wondering whether or not this will be the biggest mobile device since the smartphone.But will people really want to own and wear one?Some people, of course, can’t wait.New gadgets can still titillate and excite even the most jaded consumer.</p>
