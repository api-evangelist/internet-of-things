<p>Exposing data through APIs is a well-worn topic.  At Mashery, we talk about it literally all the time.  But we usually focus on a company exposing its own data sets through APIs to inspire innovation.  What we don’t talk about as often, is how whole industries can use APIs to increase productivity and efficiencies. 
In the last few years there has been a spread of low-cost sensors that have made it possible to monitor a large variety of machines and machine-handled processes.</p>
