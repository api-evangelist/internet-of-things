<p>If you pay $1,500 for something, you generally want to at least have the option of selling it, should it be necessary.Unfortunately for the 8,000 people chosen for Googles Glass Explorer Program, Google can (and probably will) deactivate your device if you try to sell it or give it away.If you suddenly become strapped for cash or decide you dont like Glass, tough luck.The rule imposed by Google in its terms of sale on the device came to light when a Philadelphia man who was chosen as an Explorer tried to sell his Glass on eBay.The man told Wired that he didnt realize that he wasnt allowed to sell his Glass until he was informed by other members of the Google Explorers Google+ Group.</p>
