<p>Last week, Google finally released the developer guides and other necessary documents that will allow developers to write apps for Glass.In some respects, the so-called Mirror API may have been a disappointment to developers who were expecting to run full-blown augmented-reality apps, but even in its current form, it will allow developers to create new experiences for their new and existing apps that just weren’t possible before.One thing many developers may not have realized before Google published these documents is that the API is essentially an old-school RESTful service.The only way to interact with Glass is through the cloud.The only apps you can build – at least for now – are web-based, and despite the fact that Glass runs Android, you can’t run any services directly on the hardware.</p>
