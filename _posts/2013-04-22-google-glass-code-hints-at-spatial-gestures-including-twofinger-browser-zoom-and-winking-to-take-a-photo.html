<p>Google appears to be planning an interesting set of gestures for its Glass project, letting you use your fingers, head, and eyes to perform certain functions.Two examples include being able to use two fingers to zoom in and out of the browser, apparently just like on a touch device, as well as winking to take a photo.The leaked information comes to us courtesy of Reddit user fodawim (via Glass Apps), who found the new gestures “buried deep” in MyGlass, the Google Glass companion app that launched last week.He took a screenshot of the code showing some very interesting tidbits:
 
 The most interesting mentions in our opinion include HEAD_GESTURES, EYE_GESTURES (including WINK_TAKE_PHOTO), BROWSER_TWO_FINGER_ZOOM, GUEST_MODE, and COMPANION_SCREENCAST.Given that the first two are categories, one could assume that there will be multiple types of each, even though there is only one of each listed right now.</p>
