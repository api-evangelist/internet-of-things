<p>Chris Anderson wrote Makers and went from editor-in-chief of Wired to CEO of 3D Robotics, making his hobby his side job and then making it his main job.A new executive at Motorola Mobility, a division of Google, said that Google seeks to “googlify” hardware.By that he meant that devices would be inexpensive, if not free, and that the data created or accessed by them would be open.Motorola wants to build a truly hackable cellphone, one that makers might have ideas about what to do with it.Regular hardware startup meetups, which started in San Francisco and New York, are now held in Boston, Pittsburgh, Austin, Chicago, Dallas and Detroit.</p>
