<p>Remember when Bluetooth phone headsets came along and suddenly there were all these people loudly talking to themselves in public?Schizoid behavior became, if not cool, at least somewhat tolerable.Well expect the same experience now that Google Glass is hitting the street, because contrary to nearly any picture you can find of the thing, when you actually use it most of your time is spent looking up and to the right, where the data is.I call it the Google Gaze.Only time will tell how traffic courts will come to view Google Glass, but having finally tried one I suspect it may end up on that list of things we’re supposed to drive without.</p>
