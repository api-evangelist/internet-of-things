<p>An enterprising developer has created a Google Glass app that allows users to  take photos by winking.The app uses functionalityÂ  discovered in the Google Glass code  last week that appears not to be enabled by default.The app, named Winky, works by rearranging the priority of the wink gesture within a user build.Google Glass comes with the wink gesture disabled within a user build and will tell itself to discount any wink gestures that it sees.I wound up decompiling some of the code that was on the Glass devices and investigating there.</p>
