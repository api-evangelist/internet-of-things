<p>Google Glass might be having a few issues of late, but if youre not impressed by the idea of wearing glasses constantly and winking to take pictures, you might have another option before long.Engadget has posted an image of a new watch-based device, patented by Google, which would perform many of the same functions.While the drawing does not necessarily mean such a product is in the works for commercial release, it does hint at an intriguing new direction for the companys move into wearable computing.The device would have familiar Smartwatch functions such as a display, processor and wireless connection - presumably to an Android phone or tablet.But it would also have two touchpads on either side of the watch which could be used for gesture-based input.</p>
