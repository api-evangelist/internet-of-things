<p>When the Internet goes down, so too does modern life.Like it or not, having a connection to the Internet means that you can be informed, available, and part of the global conversation.Offline, you are just sitting there.Alone.Kickstarter project BRCK wants to make sure that no matter where you are in the world, you can be online.</p>
