<p>If youre visiting the Google I/O developers conference this week, youre a tiny part of a giant Google experiment to sniff out everything from your body heat to your breath.Google is even listening to your footfalls as part of its Data Sensing Lab I/O 2013.Think thats a scary, Big-Brother invasion of privacy?The conference attendees I talked to didnt seem to mind.In fact, one wanted Google to collect even more data.</p>
