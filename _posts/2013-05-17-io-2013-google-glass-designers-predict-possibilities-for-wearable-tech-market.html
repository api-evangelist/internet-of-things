 SAN FRANCISCO -- Even without a major presence during the opening keynote, Glass has easily been the most popular product at Google I/O 2013.There approximately 6,000 attendees at this years developer conference, and you cant walk a few steps without bumping into someone sporting the Android-powered specs.While this might be the one place on the planet still where Glass might appear mainstream to the casual observer, there is no denying that the fervor around Glass isnt dying down soon.Thats helped by the fact that Google revealed a few more notable apps in the pipeline that should make Glass more useful, including apps from Twitter and Evernote.</p>
