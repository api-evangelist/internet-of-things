<p>The company behind the Pebble smartwatch, which not only looks awesome but connects up to your iPhone, has picked up US$15 million in funding from venture capitalists, and has released yet another version of its SDK.The funding is obviously a solid chunk of change, and should help Pebble not only fulfill its current orders (the company is still aiming to get watches out to all of its supporters from a successful Kickstarter bid), but push the company on into the future as well.This latest SDK release, called the PebbleKit, allows for two-way communication back and forth between the watch and your smartphone, which means there are lots of new options for apps to work with the watch as a display or even a remote control.The company has also released a Sports API, which should allow for GPS-enabled apps (like running apps) to send and receive information from the watch.Pebbles initial set of features was quite limited, but this API update should make a lot of new apps possible, and of course well likely see more in the future.</p>
