<p>One of the great things that happens as a technology advances is seeing the great new uses it can get put to.On yesterday’s panel at Connections Connected Home Event in Las Vegas this week (collocated with CITA2013) there were some great opinions from the panelists on how the App Economy is evolving especially for the connected home.Panel details are here – with Panelists from Accedo, Apsalar, Adobe, Pandora and ourselves.Getting content and services onto connected home devices, tapping into home infrastructure and creating a uniform experience is clearly.The panel covered a wide range of topics from integration with CE devices to business models and distribution.</p>
