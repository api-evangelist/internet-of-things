<p>Khronos Group, open standards consortium behind some of today’s most innovative technologies, has announced a new initiative to develop an open, royalty-free API for advanced, low-level control of mobile and embedded cameras and sensors.Khronos created the Camera working group to develop the API and is currently recruiting participants.All participants may contribute to the standard and the group will collaborate with other working groups to enhance its effectiveness.Khronos President, Neil Trevett, commented:





Khronos has already begun development on vision and image processing APIs, but it recognized the ongoing lack of a camera API with low-level control of the camera sensor, lens and flash to generate the input image stream needed by cutting-edge computational photography and computer vision.The group aims to create a cross-platform API that offers features like burst control over sensor, flash and lens, system wide time stamping and more.</p>
