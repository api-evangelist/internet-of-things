<p>Summary: 			A Wi-Fi enabled teddy bear that lets you text your kids or send hugs while you’re away is one way for parents to embrace the internet of things.But there are many more options.The internet of things is gaining attention for its role cobbling together our home security systems, letting us play with our lightbulbs and even for helping track our personal fitness goals, but it’s also a fun toy for parents to engage with their kids.Unfortunately, since most connected devices are gaining ground because they borrow the brains and screens of a smartphone for their interface, most children, especially younger ones aren’t really playing with the internet of things widely.But that could soon change.</p>
