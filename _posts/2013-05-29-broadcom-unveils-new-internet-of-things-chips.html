<p>U.S.semiconductor company Broadcom introduced two new microchips this morning, both for use in embedded, Internet of Things-style applications.The first is the companys BCM20732 Bluetooth Smart system-on-a-chip, or SoC for short, intended for use in low-cost, low-power peripherals that work with Google Android-based smartphones and tablets.The ARM Cortex M3-based chip allows original equipment manufacturers to connect devices such as heart rate monitors, pedometers, door locks, lighting and proximity alarms, powered by a coin cell battery that will allow for operation for more than one year, the company claims.</p>
