<p>Last week, I had the opportunity to answer questions about the Internet of Things (IoT) when I took part in Layer 7’s monthly API Tech Talk.We had a tremendous response, with lots of questions and a very active online discussion.You can find a replay of the Tech Talk here.I’d like to take this opportunity to answer a few of the questions we received during the webcast but didn’t have time to answer on the day.How does Layer 7 help me manage a range of devices across IoT?</p>
