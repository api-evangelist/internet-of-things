<p>We have transcended from age of the computer in the traditional sense, into that of the intelligent network.IDC calls it the Third Platform — an IT system built on “mobile devices, cloud services, social technologies and Big Data.” Gartner refers to it as the Nexus of Forces, the “convergence and mutual reinforcement of four interdependent trends: social interaction, mobility, cloud, and information.”
 Gartner continues: “The forces combine to empower individuals as they interact with each other and their information through well-designed ubiquitous technology.”
 That is an especially cogent point.</p>
