<p>Earlier this month, AnyPresence CMO Rich Mendis teamed up with Forrester Research Senior Analyst Michael Facemire for a webinar that explored the importance of going beyond APIs to better engage developer ecosystems.The session served to introduce the need for a new product that we’re officially announcing today called the AnyPresence meta-platform.As was highlighted in the session, we’re entering a very interesting period of time in the technology landscape.We are on the cusp of entering the “The Internet of Things” era, where internet-enablement will reach devices and technologies like motor vehicles and household appliances.This will cause an interesting challenge and opportunity for companies that sell services and software, as well as manufacturers that sell traditional appliances and “white goods”.</p>
