<p>API developer skills will continue to be in ever-growing demand as infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT) takes shape.The new Xively API provides an opportunity for all developers to sharpen their skills around Web API and to learn how to develop new tools that make use of connected objects.Xively, previously known as Cosm, and before that Pachube â€“ offers a cloud-based platform to connect devices and create new products and service solutions.The Xively API is RESTful, returning data in JSON, CSV, XML and PNG formats, depending on the attributes of specific resources (such as devices, datastreams, and feeds).A range of open source libraries is maintained (hosted on Github) to allow developers to integrate to the Xively API from their Android, Arduino, C, Ruby, or other code.</p>
