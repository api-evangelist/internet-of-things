<p>The concept of Â a smart watch has been thrown around for quite a while, but is it finally time for them to catch on in reality?Pebble, a Kickstarter darling, raised more than $10 million and racked up 85,000 orders.Pre-order priced at $150, Pebble has a 1.26-inch backlit e-paper display and a resolution of 144 x 168 pixels.Instead of a touch screen, this watch comes with four buttons that control screen options, menu selections and such.</p>
