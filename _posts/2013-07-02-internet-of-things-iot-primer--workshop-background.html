<p>For those people thinking of attending the upcoming Internet of Things Mashup Day http://iotmashup.eventbrite.com/ on the 23rd July, here is a short primer on why webinos is relevant to the IOT domain, and how it works
 The Mash-up Philosophy
 Wikipedia says a mash-up is
  web application, that uses and combines data, presentation or functionality from two or more sources to create new services
 Which perfectly summarises our ambitions for the webinos technology.The opportunities possible when we start to combine the data and capabilities from distributed devices are enormous, but so too are the Challenges.Practical Porting
 The focus of our Mashup Day, is practical porting.</p>
