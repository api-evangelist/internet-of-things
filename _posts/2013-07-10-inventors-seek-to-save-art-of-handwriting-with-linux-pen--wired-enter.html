 What if your pen could warn you about spelling mistakes, just like your word processor?Lernstift — German for “learning pen” — is a Linux-based smart pen that not only corrects spelling, but can also help students, or anyone else, improve their handwriting.There are other smart pens on the market, such as the Livescribe, but Lernstift is unusual in that doesn’t require special paper and will have exchangeable pen tips — including a fountain pen module, a ballpoint module, and, eventually, a pencil module.The gadget is now available for pre-order through Kickstarter and is expected to ship in December.</p>
