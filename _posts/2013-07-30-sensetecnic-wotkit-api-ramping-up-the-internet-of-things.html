<p>The Sensetonic WoTkit (Web of Things kit) API enables developers to integrate its “WoTkit” sensing platform used to connect objects to the Internet.The idea extends to engaging “end users as ‘participatory sensors’, allowing our customers to offer new and revolutionary services.” Sensetecnic’s API joins a handful of at least 6 APIs related to the internet of things in our API directory.The API documentation reveals both Applications with OAuth2 authorization and Keys with basic authentication.Main topics covered include Sensors, Sensor descriptions, Sensor Fields, Sensor Data, Aggregated Data Renewal, Sensor control Channel, and API Features under development.</p>
