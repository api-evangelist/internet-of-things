<p>One constant in business has been the ecosystem can be more important than the product.As an example, if a person is considering attending a conference, they typically look at the speakers and exhibitors to see if there is a fit before booking their trip.In other cases they will look to see who else is attending before they decide to pull the trigger.Over the last few decades a number of tech companies did their best to attract developers to their platforms to build their ecosystems.The original IBM PC and Mac come to mind but certainly every computer maker understood the more applications they had on their platform, the more incentive there was for customers to invest in it.</p>
