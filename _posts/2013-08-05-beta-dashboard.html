<p>The new dashboard is a complete rewrite of our previous frontend dashboard and aims to empower end users to have better control over their user experience with their devices through an advanced widget system integrated within the Ninja Blocks platform
 
 Our previous dashboard had a one-to-one binding of device to widget.Unfortunately this limited how we could represent sensors and actuators, especially those that exposed themselves as multiple devices to the Ninja cloud.We wanted to de-couple the dependency on us at Ninja Blocks deciding how best to represent your devices by extracting out the widget representation from our backend.Widgets now have a simple structure that can be easily ported across to other devices.With the new structure, it is now possible to:
 Create aggregate widgets that make use of data from multiple devices (no restriction as long as the device exists in your account)
 Use a device in multiple widgets.</p>
