<p>So I’d like to introduce you to a new piece of technology we have released this week, the Splunk Universal Forwarder for Linux ARM (Raspberry Pi).Tested for deployment on Raspberry Pi, this version of the forwarder is designed to allow end users to capture data on embedded, low power ARM based devices and forward that data to Splunk Enterprise, Cloud, Storm, or Free instances.You can download the release, for free, right now at http://apps.splunk.com/app/1611/
 I’ve got to assume that this forwarder will be a first introduction to Splunk for many in the Raspberry Pi community, so let me briefly tell you a bit about Splunk, its purpose, its architecture, and how to get started.</p>
