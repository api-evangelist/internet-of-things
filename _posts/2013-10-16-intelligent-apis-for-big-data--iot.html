<p>“Data is the new oil” is an oft-repeated phrase.But when was the last time you went out and bought a barrel of crude oil?  The value to consumers is in the refined product: gasoline.With data, the refined product is information – the distilled and actionable essence of multiple sources of raw data.  So, if “data is the new oil” then “information is the new gasoline”.</p>
