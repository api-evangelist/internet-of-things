<p>An ecosystem of utilities, documentation, and modules that make software development for hobbyist hardware easier, faster, and generally more fun.Software development for hobbyist hardware has not progressed nearly as much as the hardware itself has in the last few years.Arduino IDE makes it easy for people on any platform to get started and that is valuable, but advanced use cases are harder.Currently, to use libraries you find on the internet, you are left copy and pasting them into your project, or putting the files into multiple directories in the IDEs directory.The first aim will be clean up the build system.</p>
