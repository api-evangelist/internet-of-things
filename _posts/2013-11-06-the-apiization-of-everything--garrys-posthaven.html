<p>Everything that used to be fax machines, contracts, and invoices and purchase orders in triplicate are going away.Whats replacing it?The API.Before Stripe, you had to fill out a ton of forms and get approval to get a merchant account.Now you can sign up on a website and make simple REST API calls.</p>
