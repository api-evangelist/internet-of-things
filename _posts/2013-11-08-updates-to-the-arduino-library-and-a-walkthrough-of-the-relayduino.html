<p>I’ve been working on updating our Arduino Library.If you haven’t heard of Arduino yet, it’s a really cool embedded development and prototyping ecosystem.It consists of both hardware development boards and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with many useful libraries to quickly and easily create embedded electronic devices.Exosite has created a library that makes getting your Arduino project talking to the cloud easier than ever.Arduino & Exosite: A match made in heaven.</p>
