<p>With the digital world upon us, digitalization will significantly change the technology market through the Internet of Things, according to Gartner, Inc.While IT spending in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) will show an average annual growth rate of 2.2 percent through 2017, the Internet of Things (things, people, places and systems) will create new markets and a new economy. 
 “The traditional IT market is not going to grow at a faster rate any time soon, if ever.Increased growth will come from the non-traditional IT market,” said Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president at Gartner and global head of Research.</p>
