<p>A new partnership between Wolfram Research and the Raspberry Pi Foundation makes the Wolfram Language and Mathematica—the underlying technologies for Wolfram|Alpha—available on the Raspbian OS and they will soon be bundled as part of the standard system software for every Raspberry Pi computer.The Raspberry Pi—a credit-card sized, $25 Linux ARM computer that was originally conceived as a means to inspire a new generation of programmers—recently shipped its two millionth unit.This is the next step in Wolfram’s large-scale plan to apply sophisticated computation everywhere, in a universally accessible way.Find out more on the Stephen Wolfram Blog or at the website.</p>
