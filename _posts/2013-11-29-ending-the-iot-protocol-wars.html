<p>It’s been a while since my last blog post – not least because I have been traveling quite a bit to run Layer 7’s European API workshops together with my colleague Ronnie Mitra.The workshops (part of Layer7′s outreach program via the apiacademy.co) are vendor-neutral and focused on sharing API design and management best practices.To be honest, I probably learn as much during these workshops as the participants do.It has certainly been striking to watch how our material evolves throughout the workshops.</p>
