<p>For the third holiday season in a row, the CheerLights project is gearing up.The idea behind CheerLights is to show that we are all connected by synchronizing the color of lights around the world.Christmas lights are a staple around the holidays and with Internet-connected lights, the color of your lights matches the color of everyone else’s lights.It has been a real treat watching this project evolve as more and more people add lights… and other things.Things like Android and iPhone apps that check the latest color of CheerLights, an old Commodore 64, and Christmas trees.</p>
