<p>Monitoring is the first step to understanding and fixing almost all issues.As a hobby I have been growing my own chillies with varied success; my issue has been remembering to water the poor things.So after countless disappointing harvests, I decided to monitor my chilli plants and automate their care as much as I could by using cheap, off the shelf components.This post will detail my experiments with electronics, APIs and the Server Density monitoring tool.Chilli Irrigation System
 My first step was to set up the technology behind the components, for this I needed a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino board.</p>
