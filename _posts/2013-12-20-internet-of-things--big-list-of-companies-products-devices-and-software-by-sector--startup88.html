<p>I have recently spent a lot of time researching the companies and products in the Internet of Things (IoT) space and decided to list all of these out into a post to make it easy to see who is doing what.It’s a work in progress, it’s not complete (will never be) so please be patient as I add additional resources and information.The original inspiration for this came from a Techcrunch infographic by Matt Turck managing director of FirstMark Capital http://mattturck.com/2013/07/16/making-sense-of-the-internet-of-things/ but it was lacking URLs or any useful descriptions or photos about the companies.It has since been supplemented by about 100 other companies that I have found while looking at the landscape.</p>
