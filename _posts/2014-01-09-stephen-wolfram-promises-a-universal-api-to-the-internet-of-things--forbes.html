<p>At first glance, the Wolfram Connected Devices Project announced this week might not seem a big deal.But the database of ‘connected devices’ and their capabilities is only the first step in a much larger project, as CEO Stephen Wolfram laid out when introducing the project.Collecting data about the capabilities of a connected is the first step.It’s a first step a year in the making, and by collecting information about every connected device the Wolfram database will have a large data set that it can answer questions on.Want to find out which smartphones between $250-$300 have LTE and a camera with more than 8 megapixel?</p>
