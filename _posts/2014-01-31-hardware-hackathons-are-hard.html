<p>Many are saying were in the midst of a hardware revolution.The tools, skills, and communities needed to quickly and easily prototype electronics are becoming more and more accessible.Despite this, however, hardware is still a hard and lengthy process.You cant take an idea for a hardware project from inception to prototype over the course of a weekend - not unless you have a lot of components laying about (and the right components for the project you have in mind).As a result, planning an event like a hardware hackathon involves some extra logistical hurdles to jump over, compared to a traditional software hackathon.</p>
