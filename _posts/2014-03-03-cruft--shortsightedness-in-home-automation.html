If you make a home automation product but don’t provide an API, then you have lost my business and I will encourage others to not buy your products either.The idea that anyone buys all of their gear from one manufacturer is misguided and by making your products difficult to integrate with other products I own is limiting.Let me be painfully clear, if you publish API’s allowing others to integrate with your products, your consumer base becomes much larger than the consumer base that only buys your products.</p>
