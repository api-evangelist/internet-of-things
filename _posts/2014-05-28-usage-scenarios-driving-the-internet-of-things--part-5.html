<p>Usage Scenario’s driving the Internet of Things – Part 5   
An introduction to Phase 4   EXTEND - Provide enhanced Digital Services & Content 
Hold this against me if you want but I’m a Liverpool fan, a Red, a Koppite an ‘Anny Roader’ whatever you want to call me, that’s just the way it is, it’ll never change and having lived through 24 years without a league win I reckon I can live through anything at this stage and still remain loyal.  So you might ask what has this got to do with IOT, and if you’re not a soccer fan you might even ask, who the hell are Liverpool, isn’t that were the Beatles were from?  It was a couple of weeks ago however, while sitting in Anfield’s famous Centenary Stand watching my team claw their way to a 2:1 win over Sunderland that I first saw the 4th and final stage of IOT in all its glory or at the very least a precursor to it.Game Day for IOT   
48 minutes into the game that night striker Daniel Sturridge scored what would turn out to be the match winning goal with a neat right footed flick into the top of the net that set the stadium alight.  From where I was sitting however, it looked like one of the 6 or 7 red blobs that were in and around the Sunderland goal managed to deflect a small white blob into the net.</p>
