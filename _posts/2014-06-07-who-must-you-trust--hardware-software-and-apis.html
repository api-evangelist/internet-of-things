Who Must You Trust?You must have some trust if you want to get anything done.Thomas Wadlow 
In his novel The Diamond Age,7 author Neal Stephenson describes a constructed society (called a phyle) based on extreme trust in ones fellow members.Part of the membership requirements is that, from time to time, each member is called upon to undertake certain tasks to reinforce that trust.For example, a phyle member might be told to go to a particular location at the top of a cliff at a specific time, where he will find bungee cords with ankle harnesses attached.</p>
