<p>This post orginally appeared on Masherys Strategy Services team blog.I’ll admit, not being from Silicon Valley had left me a bit skeptical of the whole “quantified dog” phenomenon.I mean, was this really something people were starting to do?  I love my dog, but I don’t need daily read outs of her activity on my phone.  It’s not really a big mystery to me; when I’m not there she mostly sleeps (that is after all how most dogs spend the majority of their time) and when I am, she enjoys her walks and play.</p>
