<p>Electric Imp + Keen IO = IoT Analytics Magic                                 
The Internet, as it turns out, cannot be contained.From our lowly beginnings on dial-up modems, we moved from wired, to wireless, to mobile, and now, we’re inching our way towards another huge leap forward: the Internet of Things (IoT).Cars  ,  thermostats  ,  pedometers  ,  watches  ,  dog collars   – more and more everyday objects are being designed with internet connectivity in mind, giving them (and us) the ability to do more, learn more, and stay better connected.The thing is, developing in the IoT space is tricky, because the companies making these products really have to do  everything: hardware, software, firmware, networking, manufacturing logistics, scaling.For some products, like fitness trackers, customer analytics is the core product, and for many of them, it’s the primary route to understanding customer behavior – did the customer successfully pair the device with their computer?</p>
