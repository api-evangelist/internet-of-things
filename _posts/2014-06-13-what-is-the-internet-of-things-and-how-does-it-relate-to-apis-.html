<p>The “Internet of Things” is the answer to the following question: “What would happen if computers and sensors were to become tiny, cheap, prolific, low-power, and were able to communicate with one another in real-time?” Due to numerous recent technological advances, we are now at a stage where the proliferation of such computers and sensors are accelerating a tremendous amount of economic activity.In short, we are starting to find out what the answer to this question will be.The mass proliferation of cheap, low-energy computers and sensors (Arduinos, Raspberry Pi’s, mobile phones,  Intel® Galileo, and eventually Intel® Edison Development Boards.The ability for these computers and sensors to communicate using new low-energy wireless protocols like ANT+, Bluetooth LE, Z-Wave, EnOcean, 6LoWPAN or ZigBee, RFID and NFC.</p>
