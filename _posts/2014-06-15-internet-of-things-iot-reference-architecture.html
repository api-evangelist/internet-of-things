<p>To converge Internet of Thing devices with corporate IT solutions, teams require a Reference Architecture for the Internet of Things (IoT). The reference architecture must include  devices,  server-side capabilities, and cloud architecture required to interact with and manage the devices. A reference architecture should provide architects and developers of IoT projects with an effective starting point that addresses major IoT project and system requirements.A more detailed architecture component description  can be found in the IoT Reference Architecture White Paper.</p>
