<p>Fire, the first smartphone designed by Amazon, introduces a new technology called Firefly which enables customers to quickly identify printed web and email addresses, phone numbers, QR and bar codes, plus over 100 million items, including movies, TV episodes, songs, and products.Customers simply press and hold the dedicated Firefly button to discover useful information and take action in seconds. 
  	With the Firefly SDK, developers can build apps that recognize real world objects—music, movies and more—and let customers interact with them.As a developer, you can create more immersive experiences that increase both engagement and the frequency of app use.The Firefly SDK comes with built-in recognizers and databases for products, music, movies, URLs, and websites, as well as built-in actions such as dialing a phone number, looking up an object on Amazon or going to a website.</p>
