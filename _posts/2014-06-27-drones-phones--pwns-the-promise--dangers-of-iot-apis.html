<p>Earlier this month, CA Layer 7 participated in yet another great conference – this time, it was QCon New York.As a three-time QCon attendee, I have always really appreciated the level of technical knowledge displayed by attendees.At this show, it’s rare that I have to explain the basics of APIs; most attendees are already using APIs in some form or another.And even though many of them are very hands-on developers, they are savvy enough to realize when it is and isn’t appropriate to “build it yourself.”
Many of my conversations began with, “We’re exposing APIs but we don’t have a good way to manage our developer community.</p>
