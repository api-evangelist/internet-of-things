<p>One of the early criticisms of the smart home has been that many connected-device applications, like an indicator that lets you know when your mail has arrived, are novel but don’t likely justify adding more complexity to one’s life.So it wasn’t surprising to learn that when Nest wanted to acquire another company to add to its smart home vision the first stop was Dropcam.A connected thermostat offers a very clear ROI — reduced energy consumption and a lower power bill.Security has long been discussed as the second point application with the clearest utility for the smart home.Dropcam allows security monitoring of one’s home or small business with cloud recording.</p>
