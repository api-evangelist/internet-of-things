<p>Above: (left) Referee watch showing notification of a goal and (right) automated turnstiles.The Internet of Things (IoT)  is a network connected by devices that can send and receive data.It is different than the internet as we know it, as it is machine-to-machine (M2M) based, meaning objects interact directly with one another without human intervention.For humans this means efficient and automated processes and a redefinition of the relationship between humans and machines.The IoT enables us to accomplish tasks and be more productive without even having to think about it.</p>
