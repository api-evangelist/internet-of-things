<p>Since beacons were first introduced a little over a year ago, a handful of apps and businesses have launched successful pilot programs.In the process, these businesses have reinvented how their customers interact with their brands.In fact, we believe that beacon technology will drive the next wave of app innovation, delivering even greater engagement and value, creating new streams of revenue, and enhancing business processes and productivity.However, not all beacon devices are created equal.App developers need to be aware of this, but also need to understand the other challenges theyâ€™ll face as they work to incorporate beacons into their apps.</p>
