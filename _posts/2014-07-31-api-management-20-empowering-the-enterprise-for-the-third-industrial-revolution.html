As smart devices rapidly evolve into the Internet of Things (IoT), we find ourselves entering a new technological era—the Third Industrial Revolution.In this new era of the digital business, enterprises face the challenge of becoming hyper-connected in order to thrive.Those that can achieve this connectedness through application program interfaces (APIs) will have a distinct competitive advantage; but, they must also be mindful of how to manage their APIs, if they’re going to keep pace with the perpetual innovation that has come to characterize this era.</p>
