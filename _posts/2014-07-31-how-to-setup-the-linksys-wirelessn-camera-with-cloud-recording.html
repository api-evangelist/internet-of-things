<p>The Linksys Wireless-N IP Cam is definitely in the more affordable range of IP cameras.It comes from a very reputable name, Linksys has been making electronics, since before I was born, and has plenty of great features not the least of which is FTP compatibility (perfect for cloud recording and Sensr.net.Be warned that the reviews on amazon are a little harsh (it only got three stars over all), but, a lot of those reviews revolve around how difficult it is to set up so that won’t be a problem for you if you read and follow this tutorial!Step: Hardware setup and finding the camera’s IP address 
Hardware setup, as always, is the easiest part here.</p>
