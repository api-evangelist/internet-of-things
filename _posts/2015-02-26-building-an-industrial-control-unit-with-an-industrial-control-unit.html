<p>Back in the 70s, industrial control was done with either relays and ladder logic or new programmable logic controllers.These devices turned switches on and off, moved stuff around a factory, and kept the entire operation running smoothly.In the late 70s, Motorola came out with an Industrial Control Unit stuffed into a tiny chip.The chip – the MC14500 – fascinated [Nicola].He finally got around to building an ICU out of this chip, and although this was the standard way of doing things 30 years ago, it’s still an interesting build.</p>
