<p>ARM is already powering our smartphones, and it’s seeing its processor architecture migrate into networks that supply those phones their connectivity, but it has even more ambitious ideas for the mobile industry.It’s latching onto a new idea called Cloud-RAN, which turns the mobile network as we know it inside out.At Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week, ARM and Cavium will be demoing their concept of a mobile network on a chip.Cellular networks are typically built with their processing power on the edges, right under the cell towers that send out radio signals.As demand for LTE capacity mounts, carriers are forced to put more and more horsepower into their cell sites.</p>
