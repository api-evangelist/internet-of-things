<p>Canonical, the company behind the Ubuntu distribution of Linux, is pulling together an ecosystem of Internet of Things partners that promises to make it easier to both build and manage IoT applications.Maarten Ectors, vice president of connected devices for Canonical, says the challenge with IoT these days is that rather than being an actual platform for developing applications, the IoT as developers see it is more akin to the Internet of isolated things.To address that issue, Canonical has created Ubuntu Core, an implementation of Linux for embedded systems that makes it possible not only to run multiple IoT applications on the same device, but also to continuously update them.As part of that effort, both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft have agreed to publish their cloud APIs on Ubuntu Core.Ectors says Canonical is trying to extend the presence that Ubuntu has into the cloud out to IoT devices.</p>
