<p>Head over to Instructables to learn how to make your plants Tweet using Spark Wi-Fi and ThingSpeak.Gregory Fenton created a project that monitors his plant’s soil moisture and then notifies him via Twitter when it is time to water it.Greg built the project out of necessity to help his plants suffering from “localized drought”.Let’s hope his plants get proper watering and that other ThingSpeak users can quickly and easily build this project.Thanks for sharing!</p>
