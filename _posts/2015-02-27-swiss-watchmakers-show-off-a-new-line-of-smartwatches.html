<p>Swiss watchmakers have laughed at the notion that the industry is in trouble due to the rise of smartwatches, and now were getting a glimpse as to why they are so confident. Last night in San Francisco, a few Swiss watchmakers showed off what theyve been working on to combat the influx of smartwatches from tech companies.Watchmakers Mondaine, Frederique Constant, and Alpine have partnered with Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT) to introduce three new smartwatches that straddle the line between traditional horology and technology.MMT is a partnership between Silicon Valley-based Fullpower Technologies — the companys MotionX technology powers the Jawbone Up and Nike Fuelband — and Union Horlogère Holding, which owns Frederique Constant and Alpine.The two smartwatches shown by Frederique Constant and Alpine will be marketed as Horological Smartwatches, but they are distinctly different.</p>
