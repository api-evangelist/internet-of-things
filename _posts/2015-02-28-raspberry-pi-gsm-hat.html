<p>The Spark Electron was released a few days ago, giving anyone with the Arduino IDE the ability to send data out over a GSM network.Of course, the Electron is just a GSM module tied to a microcontroller, and you can do the same thing with a Pi, some components, and a bit of wire.The build is fairly basic â€“ just an Adafruit Fona, a 2000 mah LiPo battery, a charge controller, and a fancy Hackaday Perma-Proto Hat, although a piece of perf board would work just as well in the case of the perma-proto board.Connections were as simple as power, ground, TX and RX.With a few libraries, you can access a Pi over the Internet anywhere that has cell service, or send data from the Pi without a WiFi connection.</p>
