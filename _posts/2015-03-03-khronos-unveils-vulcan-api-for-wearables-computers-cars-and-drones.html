<p>Khronos Group on Tuesday introduced what was originally known as the next-generation OpenGL initiative, a brand-new application programming interface called Vulcan.The new API is designed to replace OpenGL in the long-term future and will address loads of markets and platform.The Vulcan is a new low-overhead/high-throughput API that provides access to graphics and compute on modern graphics processing units used in various devices.Nowadays GPUs are used not only inside personal computers or even mobile devices, but inside servers, game consoles, VR headsets, cars, robots, drones, etc.All of these devices use different operating system and sport different GPU architectures, but Vulcan is designed to support all of them.</p>
