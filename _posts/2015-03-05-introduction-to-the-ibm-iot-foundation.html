<p>An Internet of Things solution will always need to connect devices, collect data, assemble events and do so in a way that is managed.With this introduction to the IBM Internet of Things Foundation, learn how all of this is delivered in a cloud hosted service and make it the platform on which you build your next set of innovations.IBM MessageSight is designed to bring bi-directionally interactive and secure messaging to mobile applications and devices while maintaining a simple to deploy proven IBM appliance form factor.One of the most important aspects of the IBM appliance form factor is its ability to be operated in the data center with the same low operational skill level as required to operate routers and other network gear.Acquisition cost is only a small portion of a productâ€™s TCO and IBM appliances are specifically designed to save you money in the most costly area of the IT product lifecycle: Ongoing OpEx costs.</p>
