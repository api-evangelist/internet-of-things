<p>We just made IoT Mode an even more powerful tool for building hardware applications by adding some brand new Conditions features.With Conditions, you can now use IoT Mode’s visual interface to specify how you want the pins on your Arduino or Texas Instruments LaunchPad boards to interact with the web services you are using, and what you specify will be reflected in a complete, production-ready program generated instantly in your browser.Conditions make it quick and easy to build a massive range of IoT applications—check out the video to learn more!</p>
