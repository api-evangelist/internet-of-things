<p>[Carl] recentlyÂ upgraded his home with a solar panel system.This system compliments the electricity he gets from the grid by filling up a battery bank using free (as in beer) energy from the sun.The system came with a basic meter which really only shows the total amount of electricity the panels produce.[Carl] wanted to get more data out of his system.He managed to build his own monitor using an Arduino.</p>
