<p>The Raspberry Pi B+ has a native VGA connection.Sure, it’s hidden away in binary blobs and device trees, and you need to wire up the GPIO pins just right, but it’s possible to connect a VGA monitor to a Raspi B+ natively.For the brave, smart, or foolish, this means you can also drive raw DPI displays.[Robert] had a few of these dirt cheap displays sitting around and decided to give the entire thing a go.It worked, and he’s written down how to do it.</p>
