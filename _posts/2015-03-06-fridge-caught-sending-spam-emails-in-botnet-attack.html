<p>In the first documented attack of its kind, the Internet of Things has been used as part of an attack that sent out over 750,000 spam emails.With the rise of the                      Internet of Things              comes a lot of convenience, such as smart fridges that let you access the internet and call for service in the case of malfunction, or devices that can monitor your energy usage and send you Twitter updates.It also comes with a new problem: many of these internet-connected devices dont have malware protection.And its now been documented that someone is taking advantage.Security company Proofpoint has discovered a botnet attack — that is, a cyber attack whereby the attacker hijacks devices remotely to send spam — incorporating over 100,000 devices between 23 December and 6 January, including routers, multimedia centres, televisions and at least one refrigerator.</p>
