<p>Dropcam customers have received an email this week informing them that in order to avail of upcoming features for their home-monitoring systems, they will need to create a Nest account.Customers are going to have to accept new terms of service and a privacy statement when signing up for their Nest accounts as well.This is the first move for the companies to integrate their products since Nest acquired Dropcam last year.Nest has confirmed that there will be no immediate improvement to functionality.</p>
