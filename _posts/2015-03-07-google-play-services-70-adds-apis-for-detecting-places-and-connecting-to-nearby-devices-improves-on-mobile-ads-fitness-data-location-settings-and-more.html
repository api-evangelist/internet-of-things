<p>The Android ecosystem –as most of us think of it– is built on more than just an operating system and a marketplace for independent apps.Its largely shaped by dozens of services that have been built by Google, allowing developers to add rich features to their apps without building out expensive infrastructures.The Google Play services package is the core element in this equation, and its getting a pretty major update to version 7.0 over the next couple of weeks.Google just announced that its about to give developers access to important new features including a Places API to get surrounding businesses and landmarks, and a new Nearby Connections API to make it easier for phones and tablets to act as a second screen to your Android TV.</p>
