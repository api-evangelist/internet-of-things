<p>We’re currently shifting from the Information Age to the Intelligence Age.The Intelligence Age will be characterized by autonomous communication between intelligent devices that are sensitive to a person’s presence and respond by performing a specific task that enhances that person’s lifestyle. The shift is driven by the consumer’s desire for efficiency, particularly in connection with everyday tasks that can be easily automated.And the costs associated with connected devices are no longer prohibitive, so companies of all sizes are able to bring products to market.Consumers are infatuated with technology that uses connectivity and machine learning to track and analyze everyday habits.</p>
