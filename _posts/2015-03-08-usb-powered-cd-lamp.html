<p>[Artificial Intelligence] has made a desk lamp out of parts he had kicking around in his parts bin.Most recognizable are the 4 CDs that make up the base and the shade.To start this project, [Artificial Intelligence] sketched out a circular pattern on one of the CDs and marked 7 locations where the LEDs will be.Holes were drilled at those marked locations, the LEDs inserted and hot glued into place.Each LED has its own current limiting resistor soldered in a series configuration.</p>
