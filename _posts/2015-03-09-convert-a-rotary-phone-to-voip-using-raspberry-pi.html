<p>There’s something so nostalgic about the rotary phone that makes it a fun thing to hack and modernize.[Voidon] put his skills to the test and converted one to VoIP using a Raspberry Pi.He used the RasPi’s GPIO pins to read pulses from the rotary dial – a functional dial is always a welcome feature in rotary phone hacks.An old USB sound card was perfect for the microphone and handset audio.As with any build, there were unexpected size issues that needed to be worked around.</p>
