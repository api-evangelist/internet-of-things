<p>Global software developerÂ SAP SE (NYSE: SAP) recently announced a string of new partnerships in a bid to step up its involvement in the Internet of Things (IoT).IoT is the concept of connecting any device, ranging from a refrigerator to components of industrial machinery, to the Internet.IoT is widely considered to be the next big thing in emerging technologies and the stage is set for its explosive growth.[1]
To capitalize on this opportunity, SAP has teamed up T-Systems for providing cloud-based connected logistics solutions.[2] SAP has also partnered with Jasper, a leading vendor of IoT services platform, for simplifying the process of deploying and managing IoT services globally.</p>
