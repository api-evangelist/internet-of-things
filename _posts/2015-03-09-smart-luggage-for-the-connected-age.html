<p>It wasn’t long ago that the main selling point of a piece of luggage was its durability — think American Tourister and its rather excitable gorilla.Not for Kevin Harwood.Like many travelers today, he is looking for technology to go along with durability.He stumbled across a carry-on bag controlled by smartphone — with a Bluetooth-enabled lock, GPS tracking and a USB port for recharging a device.It has a built-in scale, too.</p>
