<p>BARCELONA â€“ It was the last panel session of the Mobile World Congress, and the topic was business models for connected consumer packaging in the world of the Internet of Things.The moderator threw the floor open for questions, and one woman in the audience asks how this explosion of connected products could help people with disabilities?It was a good question, and I wanted to know more about what this would mean in the IoT world.I went up to talk to her at the end of the session and she introduced herself as Eve Andersson.Andersson, who holds the title of manager, accessibility engineering at Google Research, oversees the companys central accessibility team, which is dedicated to developing special features for people with disabilities and making sure that all Google products are designed with accessibility in mind.</p>
