<p>The dynamic cosplay duo known as Aicosu has an incredible number of outfits in their repertoire.Sylar Warren and Sheila Santa Maria have been cosplaying since 2009, and they do impressive work.Two of my favorite costumes of theirs are Korra and Tahno from The Legend of Korra.Sheila makes all their costumes and had the following to say about making Korraâ€™s blue ensemble:
