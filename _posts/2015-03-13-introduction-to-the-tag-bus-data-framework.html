<p>The Tag Bus Data (TBD) framework is a collection of open-source software that supports an effective approach to building embedded control applications with LabVIEW.The framework offers a lot of functionality out of the box, and that functionality can be expanded with the development of modular plug-ins.All framework plug-ins can be configured and stitched together at runtime using either a flexible configuration editor or with a collection of configuration APIs.Developers can create or reuse plug-ins that gather data from local or network I/O, that process collected data, or that access other resources (like a file).The framework uses a locally-scoped memory block, or Tag Bus, to exchange data between plug-ins.</p>
