<p>Do you maintain Windows Servers? If so, you might want to track server resources.ThingSpeak accepts data from anything and fits perfectly for server monitoring, visualization, and analysis.[NotHans] released a PowerShell Script to report Windows Server disk free space to ThingSpeak.Once in ThingSpeak, use a ThingSpeak to visualize server resources and send alerts to low disk space with ThingSpeak React.</p>
