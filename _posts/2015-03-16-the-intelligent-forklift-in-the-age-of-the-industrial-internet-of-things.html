<p>In one definition of the term “Internet of Things,” almost all objects have sensors, connectivity to a broader environment, and intelligence.Sometimes the object has just a sliver of intelligence; but it can be much more substantial.Objects can be products, equipment, containers, or other things as well.Traditionally, the forklift was the backbone for manual material movement in a factory or distribution center, a “dumb” piece of machinery that was entirely dependent upon the operator.In contrast, modern forklifts epitomize the evolution to intelligent, sensor-enabled equipment.</p>
