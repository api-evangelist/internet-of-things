<p>In this week’s episode of #DeconstructingIoT, we talk about the new Conditions features we added to IoT Mode earlier this month.With Conditions, you can specify the input and output pins you are working with on your board using IoT Mode’s visual interface, and the program that you generate for your Arduino or Texas Instruments board will include the code necessary to connect those pins to the Choreos you are running.It makes it much easier to build complete, production-ready IoT apps without having to write any code yourself.If you missed it earlier, take a look!</p>
