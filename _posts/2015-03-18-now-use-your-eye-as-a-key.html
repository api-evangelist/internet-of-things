<p>On Wednesday, a Surat-based tech company Biomatiques, unveiled an indigenously developed Iris recognition technology and a range of Iris scanning products in the city.The technology with a pending international patent uses a high-resolution image of human eye iris as the security code/key.The eParakh Iris Scanner (model EPI-1000) is a portable Iris scanner that Biomatiques launched in Mumbai on Wednesday.Its a plug and play device thats compatible to Windows, Mac and Linux based computers as well as Android mobile devices 
Tamaal Roy, the company’s CEO, said that since the iris of every human eye is unique, iris-based security solutions are more robust and reliable as compared to the traditional finger-print-based security solutions.“Unlike finger prints, it can’t be faked, and this is what makes it a robust technology,” he added.</p>
