<p>IoT – Enterprise-Ready Policies for Personal Data Required
By Andy Kicklighter
Given the current global furor over continuing data breaches, Edward Snowden disclosures, the hue and cry around NSA data collection from mobile phones and mobile encryption, now is a good time to stop and think before we plunge wholesale into even more extensive collection of personal information from IoT environments and devices.Think how much worse a breach of data could be if it includes full profiles of people’s movements, actions, eating habits, purchase preferences or even more personal information.  Consider at the same time the potentials for abuse if this information is improperly handled or made available.ClickToTweet: IoT – The need for enterprise ready personal data policies @akicklighter #DefenderOfData http://bit.ly/1CvgRPR
It seems inevitable that legislation will lag our technical capabilities for collection and use of data, but that there will eventually be a reckoning with the public.</p>
