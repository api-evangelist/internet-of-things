<p>Combining sensor data and 3D visualization tools can even take you beyond 3D (longitude, latitude and altitude). With the addition of time/date, tactile feedback and real-time sensor data,  you can begin adding more dimensions. Instead of simply viewing a static 3D model of an object, changing colors and other means of visualization can begin communicating actual real-time events, activities and behaviors on the 3D model. This is powerful and all real today.Digitally modeled realities enable experts, from anywhere in the world, to work and manage factories, farms and other kinds of operations from distant locations.</p>
