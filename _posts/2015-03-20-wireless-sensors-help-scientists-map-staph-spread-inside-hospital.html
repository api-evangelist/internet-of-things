<p>Whatever lands you in the hospital or nursing home also puts you at risk for acquiring an infection, possibly one thats resistant to antibiotic treatment.Staph infections are common problems in health care facilities, and many Staphylcoccus aureus bacteria are now resistant to drug treatment.Chances are youve heard of MRSA, which is the kind of staph that isnt susceptible to methicillin, the antibiotic that used to be a silver bullet.Staph is happy to live on your skin or up your nose.A person can harbor the bacteria and wind up spreading them without showing any signs of infection.</p>
