<p>Internet of things rules might change after the recommendations issued by the US Federal Trade Commission, FTC, and the commitments taken by the UK telecom regulator, Ofcom, which set out the principles for the future of the IoT that any other regulator worldwide might follow. 
I discussed in several posts about the legal issues relating Internet of Things and whether Internet of Things regulations are now necessary. But the move from the FTC and Ofcom might considerably change the future scenario.The FTC issued a report named “Privacy and Security in a Connected World“ where it provides some recommendations in terms of best practices for companies in relation to:
1.Data Security
Companies should implement a “security by design” approach in relation to Internet of Things devices embedding security feasures into the products at the outset through privacy and security assessments of the risks connected to collection and retention of consumer information.</p>
