<p>We use trackers to measure our daily footsteps, sleep, calories burned, UV ray intake, heart rate, stress levelsâ€”and thats just for us.Imagine if you had another human inside of you.As the connected world spills over into every aspect of life, technology is making its way to babies and toddlers.New devices include Bluetooth and wireless-equipped pacifiers to bottles and connected onesies.Some examples: A baby car seat clip from Intel that informs parents if their child is properly clipped in, or a smart pacifier (Pacif-i) that measures a babys temperature while keeping them from crying.</p>
