<p>The new second-generation MIPS-derived processor hub from Microchip Technology is optimised for use in space-constrained embedded apps for wearable fitness monitoring, remote controls, gaming and the Internet of Things (IoT).Unlike the first generation SSC7102, which was made available in an 84-in TFBGA (thin and fine ball grid array) form, the new SSC7150 is in a 28-pin QFN (quad flatpack no leads) package and is only available as part of its newest MM7150 motion module.Designed for use in the extremely small custom-printed circuit boards typical of such designs, the module measures 17mm x 17mm, about the size of a standard CR2032 coin cell battery (Figure 1).All components are integrated, calibrated and available on the module for PCB mounting.In the active mode, the 3.</p>
