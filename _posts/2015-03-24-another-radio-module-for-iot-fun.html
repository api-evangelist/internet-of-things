<p>The availability of cheap radio modules is making them ubiquitous in an increasing number of projects that we have been seeing recently.The usual go-to solution is using any one of the several modules based on the ESP8266 device.[Willem] wrote in to share with us his experiences with another radio module – the EMW3162 from MXChip, which at $10 isn’t as cheap as the ESP8266 modules, but is a more capable, power packed, device.The EMW3162 (PDF datasheet) is a low-power embedded WiFi module with integrated wireless LAN, and a STM32F205 Cortex-M3 microcontroller that runs a “self-hosted” WiFi networking library and software application stack.The microcontroller has 1M flash, 128k RAM and runs at 120MHz.</p>
