<p>Seniors Wireless, a subsidiary of mobile virtual network operator Emveno, today launched what it calls a “telemedicine MVNO” (mobile virtual network operator) service in the U.S.The service, which is geared toward seniors, will cost a buck a day and provide “unlimited access to board-certified doctors 365/24/7 from their phones.”
The service, called teleMED Assist, lets subscribers use any landline, mobile phone, or wireless service to either speak or videoconference directly with qualified medical practitioners.The doctors can evaluate, refer, and prescribe on the spot, Seniors Wireless says.</p>
