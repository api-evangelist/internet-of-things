<p>The Federal Trade Commission is trying to become a stronger watchdog over brand new technologies like connected cars and smart homes.The FCC just announced a new unit called the Office of Technology Research and Investigation, which will help “ensure that consumers enjoy the benefits of technological progress without being placed at risk of deceptive and unfair practices.” 
The OTRI will succeed the FTC’s Mobile Technology Unit, which was launched in 2012 to oversee companies’ mobile practices.The FTC says it would like to expand its purview beyond mobile into areas including “privacy, data security, connected cars, smart homes, algorithmic transparency, emerging payment methods, big data, and the Internet of Things.”
With this new office’s announcement came a slew of job postings, all of which focus on technology research.</p>
