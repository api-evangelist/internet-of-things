Urban Agriculture and the Internet of Things
Urban agriculture is growing increasingly popular as a viable way to address the growing food demands of metropolitan centers.Not only do urban farms and gardens use growing space efficiently, they bring with them several secondary benefits—they reduce carbon emissions associated with food production by not requiring long-distance transportation, bring money to their communities through sales of produce, reduce pollution, provide opportunities for employment, and promote good nutrition.However, developing urban farms is not easy to do; factors such as limited space, unreliable sunlight, and high pollution can make it difficult to sustain crop growth in cities.In this week’s episode of Deconstructing IoT, we look at the problems facing urban agriculture, the benefits of vertical farms, and an IoT solution to some of the climate control challenges that urban farmers must overcome.</p>
