<p>What’s happening involves the Internet, of course, but in a newly emerging context.I am referring to a phenomenon called the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This is the convergence of intelligent industrial products, processes and services that communicate with each other, and with people, over global networks.These eye-catching forecasts suggest there are many lucrative business opportunities to be pursued.But is there substance to back this up?</p>
