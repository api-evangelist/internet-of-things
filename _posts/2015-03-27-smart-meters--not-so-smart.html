<p>Smart meters were some of the earliest devices heralding the Internet of Things (IoT) era – but have they lived up to expectations?Apparently not!And as we move headlong into an Internet of Things (IoT) world, perhaps we should be a little more cautious, if early IoT history is any indication.Smart meters have been around for a long time.I remember working on a project in New Zealand, the first fully deregulated energy market in the world, back in the mid 90s.</p>
