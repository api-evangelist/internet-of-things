<p>[Chris] is a homebrewer – the tasty kind – and wanted a way to track the rate of specific gravity against temperature.Tracking temperature is easy, all you need is a 1-wire temperature probe hooked up to the microcontroller of your choice.Logging the rate of fermentation isn’t as simple, but with a time of flight sensor, a hydrometer, and some pool toys, [Chris] kludged something together that works reasonably well.Specific gravity, and thus fermentation, has been measured for centuries with hydrometers.Not wanting to complicate matters with electronic sensors, [Chris] built a floating cage for his hydrometer out of a clear tube, a kick board, and a few bits of styrofoam.</p>
