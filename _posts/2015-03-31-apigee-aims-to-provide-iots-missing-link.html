<p>As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to receive a lot of attention, a big concern is that device makers are building millions of devices that have no ability to talk to each other or the networks they are on.Application programming interface (API) provider Apigee Corp.is hoping to at least solve part of that problem by bringing open-source APIs to the IoT.The IPO-bound vendor introduced Apigee Link on Tuesday, software that securely connects IoT devices to the Internet.Link uses built-in REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs to access any device and WebSockets to stream data between devices, apps and the cloud.</p>
