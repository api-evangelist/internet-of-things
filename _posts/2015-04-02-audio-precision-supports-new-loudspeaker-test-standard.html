<p>Audio Precision, the recognised standard in audio test, has announced the availability of an application that facilitates the testing of small loudspeakers per requirements established by the Republic of Korea’s Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA).Founded in 1998, TTA is a non-governmental, non-profit organisation dedicated to standardization, testing, and certification services for the information technology and communications industries in South Korea.This application, referred to as the APx TTA Loudspeaker Test Utility, uses the Application Programming Interface (API) of AP’s popular APx audio test software to control and interact with an APx500 Series audio analyzer to verify the performance of micro and slim speakers relative to TTA’s standard number TCB-0054(00) – “TTA Verified Testing Criteria for Micro/Slim Speakers.” Tests performed by the utility include: Effective Frequency Range (EFR), Distortion and Sensitivity, Maximum Sound Pressure Level (SPL), and Impedance.The utility is compatible with APx500 Series audio analysers, except the APx511, and requires software option SPK-RD, an IMP1 Impedance Fixture, a power amplifier, and a suitable measurement microphone.</p>
